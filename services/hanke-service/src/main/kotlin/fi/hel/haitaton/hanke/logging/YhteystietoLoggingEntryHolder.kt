/**
 * Used to hold the maps of yhteystieto entities to logging entries during
 * processing, so that new yhteystietos' ids can be applied after they have
 * been saved and thus received those ids.
 *
 * Basic use:
 * 1. Create instance of this class.
 * 2. Init it (giving list of yhteystieto before doing changes to them).
 * 3. Do actions, and call addLogEntriesForEvent() for delete and update actions as they are done.
 * 4. After all actions are done, save the entities (this gives new entities their ids).
 * 5. Call addLogEntriesForNewYhteystietos() (this picks their new ids into their log entries).
 * 6. Optionally call applyIPaddresses().
 * 7. saveLogEntries() (giving the repositories)
 * 8. Forget them until someone asks something kinky about personal data (though it is good to occasionally
 *    wipe some of the older data away, because Reasons...)
