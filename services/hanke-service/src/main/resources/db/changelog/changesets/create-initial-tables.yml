              # This column is split on multiple lines just to show the different formatting styles.
              # "hankeTunnus" (and not "hankeID") in order to reserve the hankeID for referencing back
              # to this table's "ID" field.

              # Things to consider:
              # * the saving of draft states (SaveType can show the draft-state, but not e.g. the user, in case edit locking is not in effect/use)
              # * saving the user who created and user who modified. However, latter is bad design,
              #   as a single change will override previous user info; proper audit logging might be
              #   better solution, and thus having the modification info with that..
